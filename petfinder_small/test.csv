She bonds very well with adults and children alike, and is more likely to bond one-on-one than in groups. Jo tends to be more on the timid side, but once she is familiar with someone (which does not take long), she adapts very well with the environment. She is still very young, so her personality may change. Thus far Jo's settled in well to her foster homes, where she gets along with other pups and animals in the home. Josephine is still very young, thus needs a lot of attention. She does not like being left alone and does tend to follow you around or yelp quite a bit when left on her own, which can be a problem at night. She should grow out of this phase soon, and although it's a difficult phase, this is the best time to bond and form a solid attachment with her. We would love to keep Josephine but our apartment does not allow for pets, and it is far too small a space for her size.

We placed her by the bush as we had to catch up with our friends, and when we returned back to the car, she was still there, sitting there waiting for us. Her fur is pure white and has a pure pink skin. Suspect to be an Albino kitten. Very very manja and meows whenever she wants attention (not just for food).",040a9a6f9,1.0,0,images/040a9a6f9-1.jpg

My brother and I are looking for a few kind souls that are willing to adopt these poor little kittens that my brother found abandoned at a wet market in Subang Jaya. There are about 13 of them and the numbers keep on increasing as there seem to be some people who keep abandoning new born kittens there. We would take them in but we're spatially and financially restricted. We already have 4 cats at home. WE really hope you can consider (and ultimately) adopt at least one of these cute little kittens and provide a wonderful loving home for them. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have more questions. We can arrange a visit to where they are now if you want.,1b368f29c,13.0,1,images/1b368f29c-1.jpg
