We had good times together, I made him laugh so many times and he put a smile in my heart too. But times are not easy. I am up for adoption again because my owner wants the best for me.

We took him to the vet to be vaccinated. He was found to have heart worm hence the breathlessness which we noticed when we played with him. We got him treated. It was a stressful three months during the treatment period since he was not to be excitable for fear of getting a stroke. It was difficult because he was an energetic dog who gets happy and excited whenever we are around. Thankfully, he survived and has since been living a healthy life.

I hate this name. That is why I need a new home with sane owners who will give me a pretty name… like I deserve! I was found wandering around a bustling urban area. All by myself. My rescuers think I got lost. My foster mama thinks I was abandoned. My vet thinks I was used for breeding. My foster grandmama thinks I was abused. No one really knows my story… no one really knows my pain. Only I know the suffering I have borne. Only I know the darkness I have travelled through. The sad truth is, I will never see light again. You see, I am blind. My previous owners did not take care of me the way they should have. My eyes and ears need meticulous daily care. My poor teeth need to have plaque-remover applied every day followed by gentle brushing. Because my teeth have deteriorated after years of neglect, I smell a little pungent. And that is where my insensitive foster mama thought it was okay to name me Smellanor! Oh, the nerve! Other dogs frighten me. I don’t mean to, but when I am afraid I attack. My foster mama says I am no real danger to anyone. Even if I do charge at another fur-dude or fur-dudette I always miss. To be honest, I seldom know where I am. Being plunged into a world of darkness is not easy. I keep bumping into things and falling into holes. My foster mama thinks it is hilarious to call me Stevie Wondress. That woman needs to get tested! I am old, tired and gray. All I want is a healthy arm to be my stay. I pray that someone will adopt me just to love me and protect me. I am house-trained and extremely obedient. Never will I bark, or bite, or disappoint you. Never will I leave your side, until I leave this world. If you have room in your home and in your heart, would you let me in? Would you spare me a chance to live happily with what is left of my days? I hope the angels whisper in your ear tonight, so you will find your way to me. I’ll be waiting…",f9e4762d2,11.0,0,images/f9e4762d2-1.jpg

I enjoy spending time with my human, sometimes just chilling on the bed with them until we all fall asleep. and then we'll wake up and I'll get my morning dose of rubs *pur pur pur* and then we'll have breakfast together! __________________ Backstory: Dexter was rescued with his little sister, Luna in front of shop lots when they were a baby and still feeding on milk (still not ready for solids). That was why we had no choice but to take them into our care or else their fate would be sealed. Dexter have been kept indoors since we took him in and slowly introduced to different rooms by us. We train all our foster cats to be indoor because of the uncertainties of being outdoor. he is very obedient and knows how to sit. We have trained him to sit every time before we feed him.

Be warned that she is a licker :) 2) She protectively guards the house, barking when people are near. So she makes a great guard dog/doorbell. 3) She does NOT bark all the time and annoy the neighbours 4) She is intelligent, e.g. she knew how to use my dog potty mat without any training, and will obey if you tell her to sit instead of jumping on you when you're eating. 5) She's not hyperactive but active enough that you can jog with her if you want a jogging companion. 6) Fully vaccinated, dewormed and spayed with no known health problems. However she was previously abandoned and possibly abused by her previous owner, resulting in some occasional aggression due to insecurity and fear. While she is friendly with most people and male dogs, she is occasionally (not always) aggressive when around other FEMALE DOGS, and in SMALL CONFINED SPACES or TIED UP for too long BY HERSELF. Meaning under these conditions, she might growl, snarl and in the case of female dogs, potentially fight with the other dog, but not all the time as she is usually playful with other females once she is used to them. She does NOT have this problem with male dogs and she also does NOT bite people, including children, unless you intentionally agitate her (in which case, you shouldn't be adopting a dog). So if you're an experienced dog owner with an open heart and willing to give an occasionally temperamental dog a loving home, please read on. Interested adopters should: - Be experienced in keeping dogs, as well as able to keep calm and handle somewhat aggressive dogs. Angel can easily be approached by a person she trusts and touched to calm her down as I do this often. - Preferably already have a mature and friendly MALE dog to keep her company, especially if you are frequently away. No female dog owners, for the reasons stated above. I have a male dog whom Angel gets along with perfectly fine. - Preferably have garden/porch for her to run in when you are out. Although she is used to living in a house, she will get agitated if you leave her in the house alone. She is fine if left by herself in a garden whole day or if someone or another dog is with her in the house. I'm giving Angel up not because I cannot stand her behaviour, but because I wish to do more dog rescue work which involves me temporarily keeping unfamiliar dogs, including nursing mothers, at my house, and I do not want her attacking the female dogs. Also because I may plan to move overseas in a few years and will take all my dogs, but Angel will be extremely stressed if in a plane and quarantine for a long period. Thanks for reading, and if interested to give Angel a wonderful forever home, please call Carol at. Located in Subang Jaya.",a906ff5f5,6.0,1,images/a906ff5f5-1.jpg

It was directly at the back of our home, over a high wall near a neighbouring clubhouse’s tennis courts. We got into the car, ready with food, carrier, gloves and a cloth. Once we got into the grounds, with the help of the security guard on duty, we found in a drain that led to nowhere this teeny tiny puppy, crying pitifully with its last breaths. We caught a hold of her (no resistance was given) and brought her home. After a reviving drink of warm goat’s milk, little Roxanne was all wagging tail, snuggling her way into our laps and licking our hands in gratitude and instant love. She was de-fleadand was given a warm bed, and all she did for two days was eat, wag her tail, snuggle up and sleep. We were unsure if she would make it.

Faithful and I have always been pretty closed as if we have known each others for a long time. As if we are born to be bonded. In fact, our first meeting was just three weeks ago. Everytime we meet, she would wave her tail excitedly as if shes trying to tell me “Hi! I've missed you!” I often walk to the guardhouse looking for her and she would sprint towards me and keep licking my knee. Slowly, I've noticed I wasnt the only “chosen one” as she would literally do that to every passerby. 😒 Ms. Faithful is a little bit timid, but that doesn't change her love and friendliness towards people. Being that, she has developed good reputation among the neigborhood. Everyone loves her. HOWEVER, recently the other stray animals have troubled the neighborhood, leaving them no choice but to ask for the services from MPK. How can we leave such kind dog to be caught and put to sleep?! So please, help me spread the words, Ms. Faithful is eagerly looking for some good samaritan to be taken care of. Someone that she can express and share her love for a lifetime.

But before that please do consider the responsibilities of being an owner and decide only after serious consideration. There is no point in wanting these kitties out of impulse and then deciding to abandon or give them away later.

Together we can make this world a better place for all living things and help save lives. Interested parties please sent a message (via petfinder.my) / facebook private message / email and please share about yourself (eg Malaysian/expatriate?), your place (eg If renting, landlord allows pets?

Please don't just provide a phone number because we won't call/sms and prefer to correspond by e-mail first. My apologies if the above questions seem to be intrusive or offensive in any way but we are looking for a truly loving and responsible adopter for the felines. All this resulted from our experience in rescuing and rehoming cats. Please note that there is no right or wrong answers as we just wish to learn more about the feline’s potential adopter before making the decision. Thank you. *Please don’t let this put you off as we did not have any prior experience with cats either. It is something that can be learnt gradually over time and it will evolve into a wonderful two way relationship. The important thing is to look at them as a part of our loved ones and not just another animal. Where there is love, relationship and trust will grow.

I'm trying to find loving homes for the 4 gorgeous puppies we found and rescued late one night in April. We found the puppies abandoned on a hillside behind where we are staying and I'm sorry to say it looked as if they had been thrown there and left. At first we didn't think they would have the strength to survive after the trauma as their eyes were still all closed and they were no bigger than my hand. How wrong I was! They are clearly born resilient and made a rapid recovery. There have been many sleepless nights of bottle feeding the 4 puppies, trust me we've had our hands full! But now I'm really happy to say that despite their rough start they are starting to blossom into the most lovely little puppies with a fantastic temperament. Sadly, I am only in Malaysia traveling visiting family and diving and I am due to return home to the UK very soon. I have looked into relocating the puppies there but at their age it is very difficult to do so and I fear I will not have enough time or funds to relocate them all. With this in mind I am looking to find them loving families that they can grow and be a part of. They have had weekly check-ups at the vets, of which I have put together individual medical history file for each puppy. These happy and healthy puppies have been de-wormed and are in the process of their vaccinations (receiving their first dose .14)...please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or would like to arrange to come and see the puppies. xox 12 PAWS LEFT….!",7e43a342a,5.0,1,images/7e43a342a-1.jpg

He's a very friendly and happy boy who loves being petted and hugged, and gets along easily with people and other pets. He's also toilet trained to do his business indoors (on a pan) although he will prefer to do his business on grass if he can. Once he trusts you, if you go out for walks, he will follow you around without a need a for lease and will not disturb other passerbys (unless they disturb him, which is a normal reaction for dogs). He knows his name and usually comes when you call, even stands without running when showered. Romeo would make a wonderful companion for families with children or anyone who does not want an overly active dog. He's spayed and had his first vaccination. He has also proven himself to have a strong will to live and enjoy life because early in January , he was found (by me) lying on the street, completely paralysed and injured quite badly. He had gotten into a bad dog fight, suspected to be over a female in heat (hence the name, Romeo!). At the time, Romeo could not move his whole body and only could slightly move his head and needed help even to eat. During that time, he proved his intelligence by toilet training himself to go to the right pee/poo spot in my house just by observing my other dogs! Even when he couldn't stand properly, he would crawl over to the pee pan and do his business. After a few months of physiotherapy and love, thankfully now he can walk and run very well, although not perfectly and he also cannot jump (e.g. over drains, etc). Even with his limitations, he loves every chance he gets to go out and walk around, while at home, he will come to you for love and attention, giving you a silly happy derp face that you can't help but fall in love with! :) By the way, just because he cannot move completely normally does not mean he will not defend you and your house, as he will bark at potential danger, just like any loyal dog would! This happy boy who has a second chance at life is looking for a loving adopter with a big heart to give him a good home! Location in Subang Jaya",19af88854,10.0,1,images/19af88854-1.jpg

Message from Ex-foster mummy: With a heavy heart I must find her a good home where she is allowed to be dog and be happy. She has been through a lot, I only wish the best for her. Will care for her till she get a home. Terms and Condition: There will be an Adoption fee, PM me and we'll go through a interview process, if successful home visit must be allowed before handing over the dog. Bi-monthly home visit to check up on the dog. Health status: Mild Hip Dysplasia, other than that overall healthy spayed, vaccinated. Location: currently in Ipoh (grandma's house) Summary: I’m Freya Tumbleweed a 7 year old Belgian Shepherd Malinois. I was previously a skinny 13kgs, malnourished abandoned dog found on the streets in Klang until a kind hearted Samaritan found me and posted up about me on Facebook requesting for help. Foster mummy’s friend responded and took me to a vet and a couple of days I was handed over to my foster mummy. I was diagnosed with HeartWorm thankfully it was only Stage 1, I was put on a safer treatment a combination of Doxycycline and HeartGard (Ivermectin) for 6 months. I stayed in foster mummy’s care for close to a year, making sure I was totally recovered and was then send for spaying, I was suspected to be used for breeding. I couldn’t stay too long at foster mummy’s house mainly it was because I couldn’t get along with 2 out of 4 dogs that live there and I had to stay indoors leashed because of foster mummy’s cats safety ( I still had my daily twice a day walks though) and foster mummy and family felt bad for me. On the 11th of November I was send to my foster mummy’s ( now ex-foster mummy) grandma’s house which is 2 hours away since they were looking for another dog to help watch over the house. I managed to adapt myself to my new environment pretty quick. Unfortunately on the 14th of December, I managed to escape the backyard fence through a hole I managed to find and escape to find my friend ( nobody was at home except Grandma). Grandma spotted me and wanted to bring me back, I got a little overzealous over grandma trying to leash me I accidentally caused my grandma to fall (she is in recovery but slow). Grandma now prefers I go back with Ex-foster mummy and other family agree for the sake of her safety. Ex-foster mummy says I’m overall a good/watch dog but I get overzealous at times and I like to jump hug people that is kind of a problem. Long story short Ex-foster mummy is now looking at finding me a new home that has a nice size compound and family that will give me the LOVE/ATTENTION/DISCIPLINE/EXERCISE I need. I get on well in general with other dogs provided they are nice and friendly; I DON’T do well with AGGRESSIVE/CRAZY/DOMINANT DOGS. I will definitely love my humans maybe a tad bit too much, I get along with children (preferably 10 years old and above). I have mild Hip Dysplasia, I will need to take Glucosamine daily.

She bonds very well with adults and children alike, and is more likely to bond one-on-one than in groups. Jo tends to be more on the timid side, but once she is familiar with someone (which does not take long), she adapts very well with the environment. She is still very young, so her personality may change. Thus far Jo's settled in well to her foster homes, where she gets along with other pups and animals in the home. Josephine is still very young, thus needs a lot of attention. She does not like being left alone and does tend to follow you around or yelp quite a bit when left on her own, which can be a problem at night. She should grow out of this phase soon, and although it's a difficult phase, this is the best time to bond and form a solid attachment with her. We would love to keep Josephine but our apartment does not allow for pets, and it is far too small a space for her size.
